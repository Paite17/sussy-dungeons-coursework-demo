  dialogue:
  - For thousands of years, people have spoken the legend of the Sussy Dungeon.
  - The legend tells of a grand dungeon hidden somewhere in the world...
  - A dungeon filled with strange and dangerous creatures, but also great treasures.
  - 'For years many have struggled, and failed, to discover this dungeon. '
  - Most have concluded that it was just some silly tale, a lie that got out of hand.
  - But today... I found it. The Sussy Dungeon.
